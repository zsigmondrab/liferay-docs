# Maintaining @product@ [](id=maintaining-liferay)

In this section, you'll learn about how to maintain a @product@ installation.
You'll learn how to back up a Liferay installation, how to patch a Liferay
installation, and how to update Liferay. It's generally not much more
complicated to maintain a running Liferay installation than it is to maintain
the application server on which it's running. However, Liferay provides tools
for patching and updating its products that you should know how to use. It's also
important to follow secure backup procedures to protect your data and configuration.
